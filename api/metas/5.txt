The Jew as World Parasite
Nazi anti-Semitism intensified as the war went on. This is a partial translation of a pamphlet originally published by the Nazi Party in 1943, intended for use in the Nazi Partyâ€™s internal education program. and republished by the Wehrmacht for distribution among soldiers in 1944. It is a comprehensive summary of Nazi anti-Semitism toward the end of the war. By the time this was published, much of the Holocaust was already completed, and some of the soldiers who read it had participated in killing Jews. After reading this, they may have felt they had done the right thing.
