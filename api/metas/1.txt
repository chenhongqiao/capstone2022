The Jewish World Plague
Hermann Esser was one Hitler’s early followers, and second perhaps only to Julius Streicher in crude Jew-baiting. The opening chapter of his 1939 book The Jewish World Plague gives a good example of his style. He finished this edition of the book in January 1939, two months after the anti-Semitic violence of 9 November 1938. Esser feels no sympathy. He suggests the Jews only got what they deserved. The rest of the book continues along similar lines. This is tough material to translate in a way that conveys the style of the original. The book was first published before 1933.
