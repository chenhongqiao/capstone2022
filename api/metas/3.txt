The Jewish Problem
The book from which this section is taken was intended to provide a citizen’s handbook to the Third Reich, with many pictures illustrating the way Nazi Germany worked. This section presents the “Jewish Question” from a Nazi viewpoint. Citizens are told that Nazis measures against the Jews are reasonable and defensive — but there are also hints of what was to come.
