Germany Overcomes Jewry
This material comes from the newsletter for leaders of Nazi youth groups for girls. Such groups had regular meetings at which they learned songs, practiced crafts, and heard talks on Nazi theory. The issue is dated February 1944, at which point the bulk of the Holocaust had already occured. However, girls were still being told that Jews were a deadly threat to Germany.
